Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1986'},{'@value': '3'},{'@value': '5'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '138', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '87'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '90'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '27'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '77'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '26'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '87'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '9'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '117'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '12'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '62'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '31', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '6'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '18'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '1'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '49', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '1', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '37'}, {'@level': '2', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@level': '3', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '7'}, {'@level': '4', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '5', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '14'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1021', '@value': 'Economic'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1026', '@value': 'Negotiation'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1001', '@value': 'Political'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2916', '@value': 'Alliances'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2080', '@value': 'Area Majority / Influence'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2012', '@value': 'Auction/Bidding'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2040', '@value': 'Hand Management'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2020', '@value': 'Simultaneous Action Selection'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '10643', '@value': 'Country: Germany'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '81575', '@value': 'Digital Implementations: VASSAL'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '34116', '@value': 'Political: Elections'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '91', '@value': 'Series: Classic Line (Valley Games)'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '1', '@value': 'Karl-Heinz Schmiel'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '928', '@value': 'Bernd Brunnhofer'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '12517', '@value': 'Marcus Gschwendtner'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '4959', '@value': 'Harald Lieske'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '133', '@value': 'Hans im Glück'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '2', '@value': 'Moskito Spiele'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '24883', '@value': 'Ediciones MasQueOca'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '2726', '@value': 'Portal Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '15108', '@value': 'Spielworxx'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '39249', '@value': 'sternenschimmermeer'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '11652', '@value': 'Stronghold Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '5382', '@value': 'Valley Games, Inc.'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '8147', '@value': 'YOKA Games'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '5866', 'comment': [{'@username': 'jackcres', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'FuManchu', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'Play this game.

But every action by another player effects your own issues so is it like you are participating in another\'s turn.  Often when I have played this game two if not three of the players were new to the game; though some had tried to learn the rules in advance.  The first game I played took six hours as well as the second game; the third took seven hours.  In a forced game I could see going five hours but it is far nicer to pace one\'s self and just say it will take six (it has taken this long even with all players having played before).  It seems that the actual playing time can be faster, but when rules & setup time are added, this is a long game.  It is not super complicated as much as there are many steps in every turn making the process take time.  Those new to the game get the grasp of it enough to make their decisions after one or two rounds (of six); though in every case they would have wanted to try things diffently if played again.  THIS GAME IS MUCH BETTER WITH THE HELP SHEETS THAT CAN BE FOUND HERE AT BGG; they keep track of all the steps.  I do think it takes playing once or twice in order to get the management of money & resources down so that a stratagy could be followed better during playing.  It is a most interesting way to set up an election game, still making me think the same format could be used to represent the primary process in American presidential elections.

Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards.

Ce qui surprend ensuite, c'est la grande sobriété tant du graphisme que des mécanismes de ce jeu de bluff et de tactique particulièrement retors.  Dans La Vallée des Rois, chaque joueur dirige une équipe - deux contremaîtres et cinq ouvriers - qui cherchent à construire les plus belles et les plus grandes pyramides. À Chaque tour, des lots de pierres de taille sont mis aux enchères. Chacun choisit ensuite, secrètement, où il envoie ses contremaîtres, qui peuvent protéger ses chantiers ou tenter d'aller perturber ceux des concurrents, voire même de s'en emparer, et les déplacements sont effectués simultanément. Pour finir, chacun déplace ses ouvriers et leur fait faire le gros du travail, poser des pierres, encore des pierres, et occasionnellement en voler chez les voisins.  Tout, dans ce jeu, est étonamment simple: les enchères secrètes sont brutales et rapides, mais laissent la place au bluff. Les déplacements des contremaîtres - six points de déplacement à répartir entre ses deux pions - et des ouvriers - six points à répartir entre ses conq ouvriers - oébissent à des règles simples qui permettent néanmoins quelques embrouilles et coups en traître. Un système très original permet en outre aux joueurs d'accélérer ou de retarder la fin de la partie, en fonction de leur position dans la course à la victoire.  Bref, un jeu sans grande originalité mais très élégant, au thème convaincant, qui mèle agréablement et sans circonvolutions inutiles bluff et choix tactiques, et se joue rapidement. Le matériel luxueux, avec de gros cubes en bois, ajoute aussi au plaisir du jeu. --- The components - gorgeous and heavy - and the price - also gorgeous and heavy - are the first things you notice about this game. The game itself, on the other hand, is very simple and sober, as are the graphics on the board and the box.  The Valley of the Kings is a game of bluff and tactics. Each player has a team of five workers and two taskmasters and tries to build the highest and the nicest pyramids. Every turn, sets of building stones are auctioned. Then, each player secretly writes down where his taskmasters will go, either to protect his own building sites or to disturb his opponent's ones, and taskmasters are moved simultaneously. Last, each player on turn moves his poor slave workers who will carry stones and place them on the pyramids - and eventually steal them from neighbouring sites.  All the game systems are surprisingly simple and straightforward. The secret bidding is fast paced and somewhat brutal, but leaves some place for bluff. The movement rules - six movement points for the two taskmasters and six for the five workers - are very basic, but allow some fun and nasty tricks to steal stones or even capture entire building sites. The game end rule, the most original system of the game, is very clever, and winning players can try to speed up a the game while others will try to speed it down so that they can finish one or two more pyramids.  All in all, Tal der Könige is not a really original game, but it has a very convincing theme, very nice components, and makes for a highly pleasurable and fast paced mix of bluffing and tactics, with no unnecessary chrome.""}, {'@username': 'Walt Mulder', '@rating': '7.8', '@value': 'Lovely wooden bits and a good game of outmaneuvering your opponents slavedrivers to build the best pyramids.

As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of &quot;Vacations&quot; from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called &quot;ACQUIRE.&quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.&#10;&#10;December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition&#10;1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs&#10;1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)&#10;1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)&#10;1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)&#10;1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board&#10;1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company&#10;1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       &amp; 86)&#10;1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)&#10;1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions&#10;1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro&#10;1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks &amp; money, large info cards&#10;2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast&#10;2006 - Lloyd's (private) Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas. Lloyd Solon's Rules help players to correct poor strategy during the beginning of the game that can been seen with new and unexperienced players (running out of money soon is the main mistake that must be omitted!).  &#10;2008 - Dated 2008 cardboard edition with chipboard board &amp; tiles, redesigned stocks &amp; money&#10;2016 - Dated 2016 The current affordable mass-market edition. It looks at first sight to be similar to previous modern editions, but has been criticised for the use of inferior design choices such as hard-to-read grey-on-grey embossed slots and the unusual tile fonts. It contains modified rules and a slightly smaller playing grid. Although these changes have been criticised for not ultimately improving upon Sackson's original design, they are generally regarded as not being too damaging to it.&#10;2023 - Renegade Game Studio partners with Hasbro, and releases their new version, with Classic Mode or Tycoon Mode &mdash; play with or without tertiary stockholder merger bonus.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1963'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '6'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '360', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '216'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '45'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '211'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '73'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '177'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '48'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '237'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '92'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '3'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '92'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '169'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '34'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '35'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '127'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '102'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '176'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '84', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '6'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '29'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '36'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '12'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '88', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '21', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '74'}, {'@level': '22', '@value': 'Some necessary text -

You roll to see what neutral cities are willing to pay for resources (or negotiate with cities of other players). You roll to see if your artists make art. Even your tax income is largely a roll of the dice. Buildings can be expensive to buy, but random earthquakes can just destroy them, even when triggered by an event on another players turn (if they have no buildings, the earthquake goes to someone who has a building). And how many event cards you draw is based on the dice too. Your goal cards are randomly assigned at the start, and not equal. And hard to complete even the majority of your goal, so even if you are doing well, it may not feel like it. It's slow to move across the map. If players converge on your side of the map you may run out of options while the players on the far side still have room. And if you roll a bad price for resources, you could wait for next turn for a better price, but that's likely not worth wasting a turn on. This is a game that feels like it's meant to be a Euro game, but it's just too lucky. It has fiddly rules and is long. You're trying to take over provinces, store goods in warehouses, build buildings, and create art. But the game just feels pretty meh.

Their success is measured twice, and in the end these scores are summed and the winner declared.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1998'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '4'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '51', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '26'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '12'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '23'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '6'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '21'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '18'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '14'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '22'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '5'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '26'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '10', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '9', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '41', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@level': '42', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@level': '43', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '44', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '45', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '90'},{'@value': '90'},{'@value': '90'},{'@value': '13'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1020', '@value': 'Exploration'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2080', '@value': 'Area Majority / Influence'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2002', '@value': 'Tile Placement'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '9959', '@value': 'Game: El Grande'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '7', '@value': 'Wolfgang Kramer'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '8', '@value': 'Richard Ulrich'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '74', '@value': 'Doris Matthäus'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '267', '@value': '999 Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '133', '@value': 'Hans im Glück'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '3', '@value': 'Rio Grande Games'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '1449', 'comment': [{'@username': 'sllang', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'derk', '@rating': '10', '@value': ""I've always loved this game, even tho I never get to play it.

The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1998'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '6'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '112', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '68'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '22'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '62'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '12'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '52'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '21'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '58'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '40'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '41'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '49'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '3'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '25'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '54'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '15'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '52'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '37', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '6'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '18'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '12'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '34', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '46', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '34'}, {'@level': '47', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '48', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '49', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '50', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '60'},{'@value': '60'},{'@value': '60'},{'@value': '10'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1010', '@value': 'Fantasy'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1097', '@value': 'Travel'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2040', '@value': 'Hand Management'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2081', '@value': 'Network and Route Building'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2041', '@value': 'Open Drafting'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2078', '@value': 'Point to Point Movement'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '7005', '@value': 'Creatures: Dragons'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '19299', '@value': 'Creatures: Fairies / Elves / Pixies'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '68281', '@value': 'Creatures: Trolls'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '42078', '@value': 'Creatures: Unicorns'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '70360', '@value': 'Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '34380', '@value': 'Game: Elfenroads'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '256951', '@value': 'Brettspiel Adventskalender 2018'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '158', '@value': 'Elfengold'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '147542', '@value': 'Elfenland: Back to the Roads'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '122213', '@value': 'Elfenland: Der Elfen-Zauberer'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '264237', '@value': 'Elfenland: Favor of the Towns'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '225880', '@value': 'Stadt Land Spielt Limitierte Sonderdrucke 2013'}, {'@type': 'boardgameimplementation', '@id': '180325', '@value': 'Elfenroads'}, {'@type': 'boardgameimplementation', '@id': '229', '@value': 'King of the Elves'}, {'@type': 'boardgameimplementation', '@id': '711', '@value': 'Elfenroads', '@inbound': 'true'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '9', '@value': 'Alan R.

Avant de caser Elfenland chez un grand éditeur, il avait publié lui-même, en édition limitée, plusieurs superbes jeux sur ce thème.  Dans Elfenroads, la version hard d'Elfenland, les jeunes elfes visitent tous les recoins de leur beau royaume. Dans Elfengold, un beau petit jeu de bluff, les mêmes elfes explorent, avec son accord, la mine d'un troll débonnaire pour y trouver de l'or. Dans Elfenwizards, un jeu de diplomatie subtil mais léger, chaque magicien elfe cherche à devenir grand druide à la place du grand druide. Le principal défaut de ces trois perles est cependant d'être devenues à peu près introuvables.  Reste Elfenland. Dans ce jeu au plateau et aux cartes magnifiquement illustrées par une Doris Matthaus au mieux de sa forme, chaque joueur est un jeune elfe qui, avant son passage solennel et initiatique à l'âge adulte, doit visiter toutes les cités du royaume enchanté. Vous l'aurez peut-être compris, cela n'est qu'un prétexte pour nous servir une adaptation en jeu de société du fameux problème du représentant de commerce: comment passer par toutes les villes en un minimum de déplacements.  Le génie d'Alan Moon, dans ce jeu qui restera certainement comme son chef d'œuvre, a été de transposer habilement ce problème mathématique dans l'univers féérique, et d'introduire, par un système de cartes, de jetons et d'enchères, de l'interactivité. Les elfes disposent en effet de nombreux moyens de transport pour parcourir leur terre: cochons sauvages, radeaux, licornes, char à trolls, dragons et nuages magiques, sans compter les fameuses bicyclettes à voile. Et à chaque tour de jeu, seul un moyen de transport peut-être utilisé sur chaque route. Pour qu'un elfe puisse emprunter une route, il faut donc qu'un jeton transport soit placé sur la route et qu'il ait la carte correspondante en main. Cela permet aux joueurs non seulement de préparer les routes qu'ils pourront parcourir avec leurs cartes, mais aussi de tenter de gêner leurs adversaires.  Sans être complexe, le jeu originel, Elfenroads, s'adressait à des joueurs confirmés. Il était en effet assez long, joué sur une carte permettant de nombreux parcours et stratégies différents, et intégrait un système d'enchères des jetons. Pour Elfenland, qui vise un public familial, la carte a été réduite, et les enchères ont disparu, les jetons étant désormais piochés comme les cartes. Cela rendait le jeu certes plus rapide et plus fluide, mais au détriment de la richesse et de l'interactivité. Fort heureusement, l'extension Elfengold (à ne pas confondre avec le vieux jeu Elfengold, également d'Alan Moon), dont je conseille fortement l'achat à tout possesseur d'Elfenland, réintroduit les enchères, ainsi que quelques jetons spéciaux fort astucieux, faisant ainsi du couple Elfenland + Elfengold une sorte de mini Elfenroads tout à fait acceptable - même si chez moi, c'est encore mon Elfenroads aux cartes toutes usées qui sort le plus souvent. --- Alan Moon likes elves. If I were an elf, I'd be careful. Before selling Elfenland to a big publisher, he published by himself, in a very limited edition, a few very good games on this same topic.  In Elfenroads, the first version of Elfenland, young elves are visiting the whole magic kingdom. In Elfengold, a clever little game of bluff, the same elves are digging a troll's mine, looking for gold. Happily, the troll seems to be a good guy. In Elfenwizards, a very subtle diplomacy game, each elf druid tries to take the great druid's seat in order to be the great druid instead of the great druid. Well, those three jewels have a great flaw: they are very hard to find, and incredibly expensive - especially Elfenroads.  Happily, there's now Elfenland. The map and cards of this boardgame are gorgeously illustrated by Doris Matthaus at her best. Each player is a young elf who, before his solemn initiation into adult life and status, has to visit all the villages and cities of the enchanted realm. Some of you may have already understood that this is only a clever way to bring back the old salesman problem: how to get through all towns with as few moves as possible.  Alan Moon is at his best in this game, which will probably be remembered as his masterpiece. He not only displaced the salesman problem in the enchanted world of fairies and dragons, but he added to the race, through the use of cards, tokens and bids, a great deal of interaction. The elves use many forms of travel through the magic kingdom: giant pigs, rafts, unicorns, trollwagons, magic clouds, dragons and the notorious wind powered elfcycles. On each turn, only one travel mode may be used on each road on the map. An elf can travel on a road only if a transportation token was placed here, and if he has the corresponding transportation card in hand. With this system, players can not only prepare their movement, but also hinder their opponents moves.  Although the original Elfenroads was not really complex, it was nevertheless a gamers game, mainly because of its large map, with many different tactics available, and because of the bidding system. All this led to a game that could last for four hours, sometimes even more. Elfenland is aimed at the German family market: the map is smaller, and the bidding system has disappeared. The tokens and the cards are now drawn in a similar way, and the game has therefore less variety and less interaction. happily, there is the Elfengold expansion (not to be missed with the old Elfengold game, also by Alan Moon), which brings into Elfenland all the features from Elfenroads, except for the big map, plus a few extras. That's why all owners of Elfenland have to buy Elfengold, because though Elfenland is already a wonderful game, Elfengold still makes it ten times better. In my gaming group, however, my old copy of Elfenroads, with its worn out cards, is still the most played.""}, {'@username': 'sksliveshere', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'Lilles1', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'Latria', '@rating': '9.5', '@value': 'DSP 3rd place 1998 SdJ 1998 Mass appealing.

Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1997'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '7'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '698', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '433'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '22'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '101'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '405'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '63'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '372'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '138'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '316'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '284'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '12'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '415'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '158'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '6'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '178'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '275'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '63'}]}, {'@numplayers': '7', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '63'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '266'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '146'}]}, {'@numplayers': '7+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '20'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '307'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '191', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '34'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '95'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '45'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '147', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '51', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '139'}, {'@level': '52', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@level': '53', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '54', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '55', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '45'},{'@value': '45'},{'@value': '45'},{'@value': '12'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1002', '@value': 'Card Game'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1013', '@value': 'Farming'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1026', '@value': 'Negotiation'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2040', '@value': 'Hand Management'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2915', '@value': 'Negotiation'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2004', '@value': 'Set Collection'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2008', '@value': 'Trading'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '65191', '@value': 'Components: Multi-Use Cards'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '5', '@value': 'Game: Bohnanza'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '18', '@value': 'Series: Bean Games (Lookout)'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '35589', '@value': ""Auf der schwäb'schen Eisenbohn""}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '103186', '@value': 'Bohn Camillo'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '285164', '@value': 'Bohna Nostra'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '467', '@value': 'Bohnanza Erweiterungs-Set'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '1494', '@value': 'Bohnanza Erweiterungs-Set (Revised Edition)'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '14118', '@value': 'Bohnanza: Amigo Bohnentaler'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '189272', '@value': 'Bohnanza: Bean Market'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '174239', '@value': 'Bohnanza: Bohnaparte & High Bohn'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '43237', '@value': 'Bohnanza: Das Fanbuch'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '216664', '@value': 'Bohnanza: Die Jokerbohnen'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '453', '@value': 'Bohnanza: La Isla Bohnitâ'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '168425', '@value': 'Bohnanza: Princes & Pirates'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '35428', '@value': 'Bohnanza: Spiderbeans'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '6264', '@value': 'Bohnaparte'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '378111', '@value': 'Bohnaparte: Liberté!

Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three &quot;epochs&quot; (rounds).  The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!&#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1995'},{'@value': '3'},{'@value': '4'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number

I particularly recommend:  Catan Starfarers Rise of the Inkas Game of Thrones Ancient Egypt Explorers & Pirates Seafarers (especially when playing with 3) Fall of Rome Helpers Oil Springs (a novelty, but cheap and super-interesting)  Cities and Knights is a niche flavor for sure, but I find it quite fun. It works well in combination with Seafarers, especially since Seafarers really improves the 3-player game and Cities & Knights is best with 3 or 4. —- THE classic game of the 90's. Belongs in every game collection. I still play this fairly often - just the basic game alone has surely cracked 100 plays, and throw in all the variants and expansions and this is an incredible system. --- Version Notes: Overall, I think the 2005-ish re-issue of Die Siedler von Catan from Kosmos - featuering plastic pieces - is the most attractive, funcational version of the game. It has bright, pleasing graphics, the smaller resource cards are easy to manage, and the plastic inserts are the most functional inserts ever for a game. It is in German, though. But every version has its charms, even going back to the borderline-ugly Mayfair 1st and 2nd printings (the ones that used photos - I don't actually own either of those printings, but I'd like to just to add to my collection). The 2007 Mayfair edition (the bigger box) is probably the nicest version that Mayfair has done, and is comparable and even superior in some ways to the 2005 Kosmos edition, the first time Mayfair has gone their own way  and done something at least as good as Kosmos. It also has the advantage of being in English. I generally like Mayfair's 3rd printing better than most players - I think it's a nice, distinct set with its own flavor apart from the other versions - but I'd also agree that it's overall not as graphically effective as the other versions, being a little dark.""}, {'@username': 'khaighle', '@rating': '10', '@value': '6 players only with the expansion set, of course, which I suppose I could use...'}, {'@username': 'bobcousy', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'My all time favourite when the boys are around.'}, {'@username': 'sarahluna', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'andy hart', '@rating': '10', '@value': ""So, it's a ten then.

The actions are:&#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&#10;&#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&#10;&#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Edel, Stein & Reich&#10;&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1998'},{'@value': '3'},{'@value': '4'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '43', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '28'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '27'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '21'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '7'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '34'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '6'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '19'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '5', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '8', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '66', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@level': '67', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '68', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '69', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '70', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '25'},{'@value': '25'},{'@value': '25'},{'@value': '10'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1026', '@value': 'Negotiation'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2035', '@value': 'Roll / Spin and Move'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2004', '@value': 'Set Collection'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2020', '@value': 'Simultaneous Action Selection'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '73592', '@value': 'Components: Gems/Crystals'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '6485', '@value': 'Misc: Mensa Select'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '67862', '@value': 'Occupation: Merchant'}, {'@type': 'boardgameimplementation', '@id': '152567', '@value': 'Basari: Das Kartenspiel'}, {'@type': 'boardgameimplementation', '@id': '5781', '@value': 'Edel, Stein & Reich'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '12', '@value': 'Reinhard Staupe'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '6815', '@value': 'John Kovalic'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '37332', '@value': 'Lüders & Baran'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '17547', '@value': 'Stefan Theurer'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '11', '@value': 'F.X.

We play with an essential variant which is to roll one die at the beginning of every round and move everyone's meeples that distance. This way the die action has more clearly defined benefits. In order to get the most out of the game it must be played with exactly 4 players.  The game is easy to teach and has enough randomness that new players are not necessarily going to lose, although it is likely. So there is skill, but I would say this is on the analytically easy side of things in terms of games that I usually enjoy.  Two things set this game apart for me and have kept me coming back for more over the past years. Foremost is the action selection. There are 3 possible actions and each player simultaneously chooses among them. If two players choose the same action they must barter to see who gets the right to perform the action. If more than 2 players choose the same action no one gets to do it. The position of player's meeples on the track determines the benefits of each action, so each round you must assess where everyone is standing and which actions appeal most to them and try to figure out what everyone will choose. This deduction/prediction is where almost all the fun is in the game.   The second element which I enjoy tremendously is the bartering. Players have gems in 4 colours, red, yellow, green, and blue. They have inherent value with red being the most valuable to blue being the least in the order stated in the previous sentence. An offer involving more gems is always better than one involving fewer gems, otherwise the greater number of red gems, then yellow gems, etc... determines which offer is better. Points are awarded for having the majority (plurality) of gems of a given colour at the end of each round, the winner looses 3 gems of that colour. The bartering affects the majorities so one has to be very shrewd when making or accepting an offer.   The game is elegant and relatively short. The density of satisfying decisions is pretty high. The one problem is the production quality of the game, the graphics are bit dated and the board has an American valley. Nothing too serious, but it does detract a little bit from the experience.""}, {'@username': 'Walsfeo', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'The blind bid with negotiation element is pretty amazing.

Because of this the downtime is rather minimal.  If you have a lot of people playing the game then it might be quite awhile before your turn comes around again, but I've seen people advance very far without having their turn pop up.  The core element of the game is the challenge and the toothy grins each player makes as they select their cards to reveal is a wonderful giggly bluffing match.  Sure it's chaotic, but its the mix of bluffing, negotiation and analysis of powers that help balance things out with player detente.  The downsides to the game are that it can be chaotic, it can take several hours to play if people don't want to have a shared victory, and you do need to learn the game a bit more than some types of games to do well.

They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. &#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;UPC 742818050029&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1994'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '8'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '295', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '189'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '7'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '66'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '162'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '18'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '155'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '64'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '103'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '135'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '13'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '163'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '83'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '10'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '163'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '74'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '12'}]}, {'@numplayers': '7', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '64'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '120'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '45'}]}, {'@numplayers': '8', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '56'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '120'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '51'}]}, {'@numplayers': '8+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '7'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '17'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '130'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '86', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '23'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '36'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '20'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '80', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '86', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '7'}, {'@level': '87', '@value': 'Some necessary text -

Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&#10;&#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&#10;&#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&#10;&#10;&#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1991'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '4'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '27', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '13'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '14'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '6'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '10'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '4'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '19'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '10'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '10', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '7', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '91', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@level': '92', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@level': '93', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '94', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '95', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '45'},{'@value': '30'},{'@value': '45'},{'@value': '9'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1055', '@value': 'American West'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1023', '@value': 'Bluffing'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1029', '@value': 'City Building'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2002', '@value': 'Tile Placement'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2017', '@value': 'Voting'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '11', '@value': 'Klaus Teuber'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '35234', '@value': 'Chris McGloughlin'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '11883', '@value': 'Franz Vohwinkel'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '133', '@value': 'Hans im Glück'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '10', '@value': 'Mayfair Games'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '1945', 'comment': [{'@username': 'luvcraft', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'Sort of a cross between Aquarius and Tron light cycles with some voting thrown in.

Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&#10;&#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&#10;&#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&#10;&#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1979'},{'@value': '1'},{'@value': '16'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '50', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '10'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '26'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '9'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '29'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '23'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '19'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '22'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '20'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '16'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '17'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '5'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '13'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '20'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '5'}]}, {'@numplayers': '7', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '6'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '17'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '12'}]}, {'@numplayers': '8', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '18'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '13'}]}, {'@numplayers': '9', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '14'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '18'}]}, {'@numplayers': '10', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '11'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '21'}]}, {'@numplayers': '11', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '25'}]}, {'@numplayers': '12', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '24'}]}, {'@numplayers': '13', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '25'}]}, {'@numplayers': '14', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '26'}]}, {'@numplayers': '15', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '26'}]}, {'@numplayers': '16', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '7'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '26'}]}, {'@numplayers': '16+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '25'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '22', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '7'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '1'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '15', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '106', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '107', '@value': 'Some necessary text -

It took me decades, however, to finally penetrate the ruleset and understand how to play it (I credit Realmspeak and the 3rd edition rules for that, btw).  The game is a wonder, so intricate and detailed, yet still epic. It has the depth of a novel, the thrill of a movie (especially the blow-by-blow combat), and the suspense of theater as you watch your allies decide whether they'll turn their blades on you.  The map is built, then your character(s) explore each map hex, looking for treasure and monsters that you can kill. Monsters are sometimes guarding specific sites, but you may also blunder into them if they decided to go hunting for man-flesh that day. You will day, more often than not, until you learn the ropes. To help, you can hire natives, or trade with them for weapons, gold, etc. Some of your hired natives can even become leaders themselves, commanding other natives. Build your own private army!  The magic system is unique: you have to “prepare the air” first by finding or providing magic of a certain color, then play an action to actually cast the spell. This step of enchanting your location in preparation for a spell can be done on different scales: in the entire hex, in your clearing, or just for you alone. Picture yourself on the eve of a big fight standing on a mountain top, gathering a storm down in a whirlwind of magic that you’ll use later to blast those two flying dragons into oblivion…  All of this comes together to deliver a rich, complex experience. The learning curve is tremendous, hence the non-10 rating. It’s worth the effort, though.

At first glance it may look like a typical hack\'n\'slay Dungeon&Dragons game, but this perception is wrong. Magic Realm is a strategy game by its heart. Each of the 16 characters necessitates a different strategic approach to the game. Heavy fighters tend to put their victory conditions on fame and notoriety and go hunting monsters. Other characters have excellent abilities in hiring native inhabitants of the Realm for help. And then there are the magic wielders, each of them with a different set of magical capabilities and spells.  During gameplay you can never just ""throw the dice in a bucket"" and see what\'s coming up. The game is far too deadly for this. You really have to think about all of your available choices, both strategically and tactically. For a fantasy themed game there is actually surprisingly little luck involved, once you have mastered the intricacies of the combat system.  There is a lot of support on the Internet for this game and avid fans have been developing this game further for more than 40 years. You will find 3rd edition rules, expansion hex tiles, more than 60 additional characters and much more. As one of my geek buddies has put it: Magic Realm is a hobby in itself - much like ASL for the wargaming community.  This game has incredible depth and nearly endless replay value.   And last but not least there is Realmspeak, a Java application of the game which lets you play with distant friends over the Internet or just solitaire on your PC.

By the time I was 16 or so, I was able to play the game without too much anxiety. I wrote Richard Hamblen about certain confusing rules, mostly regarding Natives, and he replied quickly in a bright, red pen. Since then, I have lost that edition and have purchased the second. I noticed a couple of changes or clarifications that were made were what I questioned Richard about, and am hopefully thinking that in some roundabout way, I helped with the rules...not that it mattered. The second edition rules can be just as confusing. Why? Because the game is complicated!BTW, when learning the first edition rules, I believe I counted approximately 750 rules, up to the ""THAT\'S ALL FOLKS!"" ending (which I thought was brilliant and funny). Since then, there have been even more additions...Also, the game is cumbersome and takes forever to set up. I crafted little cardboard ""wall"" to surround most of the boxes on the Set Up card, because one little bump, and the whole thing became a mess. The walls helped, but still, the set-up was extremely long, and somewhat tedious.In sum:1) The game is complicated2) The set-up is loooong.After reading the negative reviews on the game, I noticed these were the most frequently cited issues players had. However, I knew that when I bought the game. I knew that when I was 14 years old. AH rated it a 9 out of 10 in difficulty at the time. It was on the box.Given this, I must say Magic Realm is undoubtedly the best fantasy board game ever created. It truly is unparalled in terms of depth, possibilities,  imagination, re-playability, look and feel. It can be played solo or with a bunch of people. You can use your imagination (and oftentimes common sense!) to interpret rules on your own, change victory conditions, or make the Campaigns more like tactical warfare. Sure, it takes effort, but what good things don\'t? I remember enchanting my first tile to this day. The entire look of the board changed. It was truly magical.If your looking for the ""Real Deal"", look no further, because Magic Realm is as good as it gets (though, it could be re-released with some tweaks...). If you want Magic Realm Lite, then you can check out the beer and pretzel games like Talisman (which I liked as well, but not for the same reasons). It\'s a sophisticated game, for sophisticated players.SO, try it out if you get the chance. The rulebook is actually quite interesting to read, even if you don\'t play it. And remember: There really are only 4 phases (usually), and generally you\'ll just move, hide and search. Don\'t be intimidated by the more complex stuff. I think there is more common sense in this game than most people realize...I mean, if a tremendous monster hits when red-side down, it does little damage because it has simply picked up the character and is proceeding to tear him apart!'}, {'@username': 'victorpalmer', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'It is first edition.

You\'re nervous about the game-maybe even scared by it- yet obviously you\'re curious if you\'re reading this comment.  I\'ll tell you this much- Magic Realm _is_ complex, it _is_ inaccessible...but it\'s also one of the greatest games ever published, a game that truly rewards the effort and patience it takes to learn the subtleties and intricacies of a system that is far and away the most complete and comprehensive ""RPG on a board"" created to date.  The level of detail and atmosphere goes far beyond Talisman, Runebound, or any games  in its class and as a result it emerges as a much more interesting, compelling, and fun game with some really amazing systems that while not necessarily intuitive are logical, realistic, and rich with strategic possibilities.  The tactical, blow-by-blow combat system in particular is absolutely genius and much like Mr. Hamblen\'s Gunslinger each combat provides a rich, detailed narrative of the events that transpire.  Rules for natives (with varying dispositions based on your character), different types of magic, treasures, exploring, quests, and pretty much anything else you want to do in a fantasy game are here so don\'t expect a dice-rolling contest with a map like World of Warcraft or a simplified pick-up-and-deliver game like Return of the Heroes (which I love, BTW).            There\'s just really nothing else quite like it.  The game can be extremely intimidating (even the setup is something of an ordeal the first couple of times) but I can\'t stress enough that the payoff is worth it as it offers an experience that modern games just simply can\'t match with their abstractions and simplifications- and that in a reasonable amount of time (definitely a single evening game).  I highly recommend Realmspeak, a Java application that, if used in concert with Joel Yoder\'s ""Magic Realm in Plain English"" rules set and the more ""classically"" formatted 3rd edition riles, makes learning the game a hundred times easier than simply opening the rule book and reading straight through.  There are reasons this game is still passionately loved by some and passionately hated by others and I believe that if you take the time to come to terms with the game\'s terribly presented yet beautiful rules (which were, IMHO, way ahead of its time)then you\'ll find it hard not to love it.  Or, you can just throw your hands up in the air like many people do and be satisfied with Runebound.    A real masterpiece that is likely as close to a piece of literature that a board game can get- epic, difficult, rich, polarizing, dense, and thoroughly engrossing.

The abilities of each character in MR determine entire classes of monsters, natives and other characters that you are capabable of defeating. They are each capable of following different victory strategies, some are more flexible than others...Some characters fare best all by their lonesome, while others are better for supporting a party.  Luck and randomness are a big part of the game, but it doesn\'t feel random! Clues tip you off that a type of monster is going to show up - it\'s only a matter of when. Do you want to hang around this place knowing a Tremendous Troll could show up at any moment? You must make the best decision by balancing your ability to fight or evade the troll with what you want to get out of the area (e.g. treasure looting or just passing through). The game is full of these ""push your luck"" types of decisions. Beautiful design.  The combat system is unique and intriguing. An elegant chit system determines attack and move strength, speed and fatigue. It has to be experienced.  Magic Realm polarizes players\' opinions - the complex rules can be daunting - but it seems that persistent players eventually love the game! We\'ve seen ""conversions"" where a player who couldn\'t stand the game does a complete 180 because he gave the game a few more tries, and the rules eventually clicked.

Every time I come back to it, I\'m astounded at its depth, narrative, originality, and challenge. Learning all of the various subsystems of the game, including combat with natives and magic, requires a great deal of study and practice, but the result is a game almost unparalleled in its possibilities.  Update 2: With the release of Mage Knight, Magic Realm finally has a competitor in the ""serious fantasy adventure game"" niche some 30 years after its publication. I still think MR edges out MK in overall quality, especially on narrative. But MK, despite its complexities, is a whole lot easier to pick up and play without spending a day relearning rules intricacies. I can\'t ever see giving up on MR completely, but I think I\'ll often reach for MK unless I truly have the time to spare that\'s required to dive back into MR. Dropped rating to a 9.  Update 3: No... Mage Knight is fine and worthwhile, but it\'s no Magic Realm. MK just doesn\'t have the same sense of narrative and surprise. I haven\'t played MK in years and don\'t particularly miss it.

Likewise when it comes to the idea of extreme asymmetry in game design the world starts here. Cosmic encounter certainly gets recognized as it much older contribution. But it’s still a minimal asymmetry or single gimmick. Sadly too many modern games fall into single gimmick asymmetry in tribute. But here we see entire systems around character abilities.

It was AWESOME fun solo, the randomized personalities, the alliance system with the NPC kingdoms, the back and forward, the narrative and provoking world the game is situated in, the randomize chit-pull turn order mechanism makes for a great solo experience, there is a zillion ways to mess with the other players and come back from the brink of disaster.

Also players need to understand certain game truisms in order to give themselves the best chance of winning.  I'm a firm believer that London-Paris-Hamburg should never attack each other in their home areas (apart from perhaps a little Hamburg-Paris sniping in the eastern reaches of Area III).  Every time I've seen two of the northern powers fight, a Mediterranean power has won, and the battlers finished far off the pace.  Also one needs to be willing to pay out others' commodities to get their own paid out in return.  Otherwise the game turns into a pure lottery, victory to whoever can draw the best cards.

I still remember one game when we played with only one L star card in the resource deck and 3 nukes.  Everyone had nukes, but L stars were rare.  We all had about 3 nukes just to play the MAD game.  Suddenly, I farmed a L star out of the resource deck, but I didn't have the money to build and cover my expenses next turn.  My buddies mood went bleak as I was envisioning extorting them every turn for money to fund my new L star deployment program.  (yes, I am evil, eeeevil)  My buddy Jason pulled off the greatest play I think I ever saw in the game. He nuked my entire mineral production.  No L star for me, no matter how much money I had.  And I had just spent all my savings mining the resource deck for the L star.  I could not afford mine for mineral.  God bless Jason where ever he is.  This game is LOADS OF FUN and will create memories.  The only reason I only gave it a 7 instead of 9/10 is it takes time.  I mean TIME. Expect to start around noon, and play the game until its time to hit the bar, if you decide to hit the bar.  Many times we played on.    I say it takes time, but we had all the expansions: tanks, subs, spies, unconventional forces, neutron bombs, pirates, warlords, fortuna and high tech.  We even used the 5x8 huge map, which my friend had laminated.     The basic game is easy to learn and can maybe take a couple of hours depending on how you play.  Each round has 2 things everyone does, and you have to choose 3 out of the next six things you can do.  More forces gets a die advantage, as well as having more l stars.  Its simple math, even I understood it.    I highly recommend everyone to at least give the basic game a try.""}, {'@username': 'franckchosson', '@rating': '9', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'mikenoble', '@rating': '9', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'wemyss', '@rating': '9', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'fbparis', '@rating': '9', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'Will_Annand', '@rating': '9', '@value': 'I was Game Master / Developer on this title.'}, {'@username': 'plmccaffrey17', '@rating': '9', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'Gershwin27', '@rating': '8.9', '@value': ""This was my first true (non- MB,PB,Hasbro) board game that I played.

On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay siege to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.&#10;&#10;Dark Tower was technologically impressive when it was released in 1981.  Gameplay was facilitated by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors.

Each side has its own style of play as the pieces move differently.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1975'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '2'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '5', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '3'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '3'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '7', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '1', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '156', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@level': '157', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '158', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '159', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '160', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '30'},{'@value': '30'},{'@value': '30'},{'@value': '8'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1009', '@value': 'Abstract Strategy'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1055', '@value': 'American West'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1041', '@value': ""Children's Game""}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2676', '@value': 'Grid Movement'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '43639', '@value': 'Theme: Native Americans / First Peoples'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '26432', '@value': 'Category: Combinatorial'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '68769', '@value': 'Components: Wooden pieces & boards'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '61979', '@value': 'Players: Two-Player Only Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '5880', '@value': 'Series: Abstract (Lakeside)'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '60340', '@value': 'Series: Buchkassette (Pelikan)'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '76796', '@value': 'Series: L.BOARD (Playte)'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '24', '@value': 'Alex Randolph'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '141500', '@value': 'Wanjin Gill'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '111611', '@value': 'Dahee Lee'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '39889', '@value': 'Lisa Plangger'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '8912', '@value': 'Action GT'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '4110', '@value': 'BHS Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '21640', '@value': 'GP Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '152', '@value': 'Lakeside'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '37303', '@value': ""OPEN'N PLAY""}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '500', '@value': 'Pelikan'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '22', '@value': 'Piatnik'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '50209', '@value': 'Playte'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '41167', '@value': 'Popcorn Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '38', '@value': 'Schmidt Spiele'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '131', '@value': 'Venice Connection'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '9466', '@value': 'Winning Moves France'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '377', 'comment': [{'@username': 'charlierudygert', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'Czneref', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'AndreaGaffi', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'Themaquol', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'tobyyun', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'best game for newbie'}, {'@username': 'mattman', '@rating': '9', '@value': 'Quick and fun.

Players command one or more races in a variety of scenarios as they replay the &quot;historical&quot; situations in the galactic politics of the future.&#10;&#10;It is the base set for the Federation and Empire series of products.&#10;&#10;The Star Fleet Universe series is based on the game Star Fleet Battles, and Federation &amp; Empire is a strategic game based in that background.  Federation &amp; Empire is a stand alone game, and Star Fleet Battles is not required or needed to play this game.&#10;&#10;The two games are closely related, and Star Fleet Battles can be used to resolve some or all of the tactical battles of Federation &amp; Empire, and Federation &amp; Empire can be used as a campaign system for Star Fleet Battles.&#10;&#10;The original version came out in 1986, and was published by Task Force Games.  This was followed in 1990 with the &quot;Deluxe&quot; version, which replaced the original release.  &quot;Deluxe&quot; was indicated on the front of the box to indicate it was the new version.  The Deluxe version included a revised rule book, more counter sheets, and other player aids such as the battle board and player folio.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Deluxe&quot; version had three expansions:&#10;&#10;    Federation & Empire: Carrier War&#10;    Federation & Empire: F & E Module 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Special Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: F & E Module 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Marine Assault&#10;&#10;&#10;In 2000, another revision of the rules was completed, and the F&amp;E 2K (as it is called) version stood for a decade.&#10;&#10;In 2010 the countersheets were entirely redone (with a larger number of counters per sheet) and the rulebook was once again revised to incorporate the last 10 years of errata and rulings, allowing a better integration with the expansions that were released during this period.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Federation & Empire: Advanced Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Combined Operations (combined and replaced Federation & Empire: F & E Module 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Special Operations and Federation & Empire: F & E Module 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Marine Assault)&#10;    Federation & Empire: Fighter Operations (replaced Federation & Empire: Carrier War)&#10;    Federation & Empire: Planetary Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Strategic Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: ISC War&#10;    Federation & Empire: Minor Empires&#10;&#10;&#10;Since 2010 ADB has created, in both print and pdf form, Compendium I, II and III. The first two covered the F&amp;E sections in Captains Log&rsquo;s 21-40. All material for the base game from these is in the 2010 rule book however material for the expansions Advanced, Combined, Planetary and Strategic Operations are in the first two Compendiums&rsquo;. Compendium III has Captains Log&rsquo;s 41-50 which were all printed post 2010 rules.&#10;&#10;Fighter Operations is now updated to the 2010 standard.

Each person secretly chooses a 5 letter word. On a turn, you pick any letter in another persons word and ask if a particular type of rune helps make up that letter. If it does, you get a point and another guess. If it doesn't, end of go and the other player gets a point instead.  At any time you can guess another player's word. If you get it right, you score points for the full number of runes that make up the completed word. If wrong, you lose a point for each rune that has so far been guessed correctly on the incomplete word. If you guess correctly, and you're 25 points or more before the guess, you win the game.  For anyone who has trouble visualising or cycling through word possibilities from incomplete pictures (count me), this is a truly horrible game. If you like this sort of puzzle, it may appeal. In between turns is spent trying to puzzle out other people words (so there's little perceived downtime) and your go is typically spent working on the word of whoever's coming last so if you're not successful, at least its only the last player that gets a point.

Those who often only gave it one try and packed it away may have missed a couple of critical aspects. One, is that this game only works well with exactly four players (five if you are using the islands), and two, all players need to be of equal skill. Otherwise, it is easy for a newbie to give the game away to a skilled player who is willing to exploit his/her inexperience. Skilled players of Borderlands will quickly point out (and abort) a bad trade to fellow players if they are about to give away the farm to a cunning veteran.    The second expansion became a must for us, adding several new ingenious mechanics and speeding up the end game with the deadly blimps.  The folks at Gale Force 9 are going to attempt to reimplement Borderlands into a Dune setting (aka. Arakis: Dawn of the Fremen) and this could very well resurrect this classic jewel if done well.

Les règles se sont avérés bien plus simples que dans mon souvenir, peut-être parce que nous avons joué sans les extensions, les îles, les universités, les dirigeables. Toujours est-il que, si la maquette et le matériel font un peu sobre et cheap, les mécanismes, eux, portent très bien leur âge et soutiennent largement la comparaison avec les jeux de conquête d’aujourd’hui.  Il faut dire que, comme à son habitude, l’équipe d’Eon était en avance sur son temps puisque l’on trouve, dans Borderlands, un système de production, de commerce et de développement qui préfigurait, dix ans auparavant, les Colons de Catan. Avec du bois, du charbon, du minerai, de l’or, on bâtit en effet des cités, des navires, mais aussi des armes. Borderlands date en effet d’avant le jeu allemand, et si l’on y produit, si l’on y commerce, c’est avant tout pour acquérir les moyens de faire la guerre.

The rules were much simpler than I remembered, may be because we played without the expansions, the islands, zeppelins and universities. The graphics and components are not really up to modern standards, but the gameplay definitely is, and that’s the only point.  Like with most of their designs, the Eon team was ahead of its time. Ten years before the Settlers of Catan, Borderlands had a similar production, trading and development system. Wood, Coal, Iron and Gold are used to build cities, ships, and also powerful weapons. This was before German games were invented, so production and trade are mostly aimed at preparing war.

On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9.

A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1980'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '4'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '303', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '200'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '80'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '184'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '13'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '193'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '89'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '5'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '71'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '147'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '51'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '178'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '88', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '37'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '44'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '1'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '59', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '191', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '59'}, {'@level': '192', '@value': 'Some necessary text -

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile.

The last player with dice is the winner.&#10;&#10;As a public domain dice game, there are a number of variants or similar games called Liar's Dice. This includes one that is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1800'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '6'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '206', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '142'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '30'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '132'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '16'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '100'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '59'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '65'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '111'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '4'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '99'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '83'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '129'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '48'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '9'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '26'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '49'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '60'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '48', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '7'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '30'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '52', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '211', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '52'}, {'@level': '212', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '213', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '214', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '215', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '30'},{'@value': '15'},{'@value': '30'},{'@value': '8'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1041', '@value': ""Children's Game""}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1017', '@value': 'Dice'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1064', '@value': 'Movies / TV / Radio theme'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1030', '@value': 'Party Game'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2014', '@value': 'Betting and Bluffing'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2685', '@value': 'Player Elimination'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '5597', '@value': 'Brands: Disney'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '100426', '@value': 'Components: Dice Cup / Dice Tower / Dice Tray'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '65328', '@value': 'Components: Dice with Icons'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '73590', '@value': 'Containers: Drawstring Bag'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '70360', '@value': 'Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '70948', '@value': 'Digital Implementations: Tabletopia'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '22160', '@value': 'Mechanism: Bluffing – Dice Cup'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '10441', '@value': 'Movies: Pirates of the Caribbean'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '5636', '@value': 'TV Shows: The Simpsons'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '11205', '@value': ""TV Shows: Wayne's World""}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '383714', '@value': ""Cups 'N' Dice""}, {'@type': 'boardgamecompilation', '@id': '7159', '@value': 'The Boardgame Book'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecompilation', '@id': '157432', '@value': ""Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest: 3 in 1 Pirate Games Collector's Edition""}, {'@type': 'boardgameimplementation', '@id': '245136', '@value': 'Bluff Jubiläumsausgabe'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '25', '@value': 'Richard Borg'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '45736', '@value': 'Rita Åse'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '4177', '@value': 'Bildgården AB'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '44835', '@value': 'Design Edge'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '78608', '@value': 'H.P.

The object is to accrue the most points during three rounds, which you do by spending your points to bid on sets of cards.  Each turn the current player turns up one to three cards for all the players to bid on, with the highest bid taking all cards.  The cards denote a commodity type and quantity/value.  The round ends when each player's ships are full, or the commodity card deck is exhausted.  After each round, points are awarded to each player having the most of a given commodity, and to the one with the most valuable total &quot;cargo load&quot;.&#10;&#10;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.&#10;One of the Knizia Florentine auction games.&#10;&#10; Related Games: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Medici vs Strozzi (two-player version)&#10;     Strozzi&#10;     Mercator, included in Neue Spiele im alten Rom (ancestor to Medici).&#10;&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1995'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '6'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '174', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '94'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '96'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '53'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '66'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '35'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '88'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '14'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '104'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '44'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '3'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '85'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '53'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '7'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '72'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '22', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '15'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '30', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '216', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '30'}, {'@level': '217', '@value': 'Some necessary text -

All these resources are dealt to the players randomly, however, so players must trade to get matching businesses and adjacent locations.&#10;&#10;This game is #2 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1999'},{'@value': '3'},{'@value': '5'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '196', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '124'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '128'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '71'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '81'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '71'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '101'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '4'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '143'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '34'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '3'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '7'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '84'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '32', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '13'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '12'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '42', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '221', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '36'}, {'@level': '222', '@value': 'Some necessary text -

Each turn, players use their resources to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available.  Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build the bishop's cathedral.  Finally, players harvest new resources for the next turn.  After all the pieces of the cathedral have been built, the game is over with the victory going to the player with the most victory points.

The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1999'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '2'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '430', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '6'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '336'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '405'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '23'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '6'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '7'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '307'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '152', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '20'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '92'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '35'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '130', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '236', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '130'}, {'@level': '237', '@value': 'Some necessary text -

There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board. There are also color-coded targets on boards. Placed on top of the surface are four robots. The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it. Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots that will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1999'},{'@value':

Jay had had a few well recieved games in the previous 2 years with the likes of Samurai, Bohnanza, Kahuna, Mississippi Queen, Canyon and Lowenherz (which are all very good), but in 1999 his list of published games tripled and Rio Grande started to earn the stellar reputation he now has in the gaming world. In those days, you could buy just about ANY RG game and know that you were going to have a good time. Tikal was definately one of those games.  I was very fortunate to hear that Jay was going to be at Match Play in Mountain View during the weekly Wednesday nite game session and I had already heard a little about Tikal at that time on rec.games.board (BGG was not even around at this time). I went to game night and was thrilled to meet Jay and I got to talk with him at length about his games and even bent his ear about my  own game I was designing at the time (and still am!).  When it was time to play, I mentioned that I really was interested in trying Tikal and Jay obliged and pulled out his brand spanking new copy of it. He went through the rules in a few minutes and got us up and running as he watched the first few turns to make sure we were ok before teaching another game to the next group.   Tikal was amazing. I had never seen anything like it. The board and artwork were simply stunning, even to this day I would be hard pressed to mention another game with such beautiful components. What really impressed me however, is how involved the game was. EVERY turn was agonizing as you dont have enough action points to do everything that you want to do. There is a brilliant balance of methods to earn victory points and the scoring rounds themselves were unique in that all players took a turn ""during"" another players turn.  Jay came up at one point when one of the guys was taking a long time to take a move and simply said ""This is a fast paced German game"". We had no more problems after that and I\'ve used that line every time I\'ve taught the game and our group doesnt suffer from the curse of Analysis Paralysis like others seem to have with Tikal.  The other thing that I love about this is the THEME which is elegantly woven into the gameplay. You really feel like you are Indianna Jones and you are searching for the Ark of the Covenant. I can\'t see this game using any other setting and still being as big of a success as it is. I will never turn down a game of Tikal.  ...[b] Abstract [/b]...__________[]...[b]Themed [/b]..... .........[b] Luck [/b]..._________[]_...[b] Skill [/b]........... ......[b] Simple [/b]..._______[]___...[b] Complex [/b]... ..[b] Strategic [/b]..._______[]___...[b] Tactical [/b].... ....[b] Friendly [/b]..._______[]___...[b] Cutthroat [/b].. .......[b] Fiddly [/b]...__________[]...[b] Elegant [/b].....

The game is set in Europe. Each player is provided with a pool of wooden tokens to represent their civilizations.  Each player selects a combination of civilization tiles, which give his civilization special abilities or characteristics.  Players enlarge their empires through territorial expansion, often at the expense of other players.  The key to the game lies in choosing when to allow your active civilization to go into decline in order to select a new one that will generate more points.

Your objective: the exalted title of &quot;Shogun&quot;. As &quot;Shogun&quot;, you will have the right to enforce the emperor's will, and become the real ruler of Japan.&#10;&#10;Samurai allows you to take control of Japan. In medieval Japan, the central government of the emperor was dissolved. He become a powerless figurehead while various clans competed to take control of the country. &#10;These clans were similar to the noble houses of Europe; and their leaders the equivalent of medieval Dukes, Barons, Counts, and the like. &#10;Using formldable samurai warriors, the clans waged endless wars across the major islands of the Japanese archipelago.&#10;&#10;Concept of Play &#10;Each player controls a clan, with one or more lords. Each lord has a province representing his personal &quot;fief&quot; or home, and often has additional holdings of troops, titles, ships, castles, and more provinces.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 20 turns, each representing a pace of historical events running between a few months to a few years. In each turn, moves are conducted on a mapboard that portrays the three major islands of Japan.&#10;&#10;The playing pieces-360 in all-include Samurai Lords, clan control markers, holdings and title counters, troops, garrisons, and more; all explained in the easy&shy; to-follow prose of the 18-page rules folder.&#10;&#10;Many Games in One &#10;An excellent game for 2 to 8 players. Samurai is suitable for beginning and intermedlate play, with plenty of optional rules and strategic options for even the expert. And for the really hard-core power-politics fanatics, special rules create a nearly &quot;perpetual&quot; game representing tho true ebb and flow of Japanese feudal confilct. &#10;Samurai includes a variety of playing aids to make learning and playing the game truly an effortless task. The rules manual contains historical background and designer's notes that offer the player the full flavor and authenticity of what medieval conflict was all about in the age of the &quot;Shogun&quot; struggles.&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;Samurai is a game about warfare and politics in feudal Japan. The aim of the game is to gain the title &quot;Shogun&quot; by game end. To become Shogun, the player has to gain control of two out of four Imperial Articles scattered across the mapboard. These are: the Emperor, The Heir, The Imperial Regalia and Kyoto Castle.&#10;&#10;Playing pieces are the samurai lords of various houses. Each lord has a home province which provides him with troops.

It's a multiplayer wargame with a card-driven combat system and a political layer that players must contend with.&#10;&#10;For just over one hundred years England and France battled over who would sit on the French throne. Even within France itself factions developed, putting forth their own candidates challenging the rights of the Dauphin. From this struggle heroes emerged, notably the Black Prince and Jeanne d'Arc, The Maid of Orleans. Tremendous battles were fought at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt, yet their impact on the war was ephemeral. Long sieges followed short campaigns, bands of the notorious Free Companies, temporarily unemployed, marauded across the countryside in search of rapine and plunder. Complicating matters, both famine and plague poisoned the seasons.

Those can be spent on Battle Cards and fortification.&#10;&#10;Battles are resolved by playing Battle Cards (yellow(numerical) or red(special cards), combined with Influence, fortifications, and die roll.&#10;&#10;TURN SEQUENCE&#10;Income phase: based on controlled cities&#10;Political phase: vote for War or Peace&#10;Battle Cards collection  &#10;Purchase fortifications and/or cards.  &#10;Player Order phase&#10;Event(s) phase&#10;Foreign Intervention phase&#10;Player Turns: In player order, each player resolves:  &#10;1-Expansion moves&#10;2-Combat only if 2+ Yellow cards;

Each turn a card is revealed that displays 3 actions that players can choose from. Each player in turn choose an action by playing a 1, 2 or 3 card identifying the first, second or third action on the revealed card. The beauty of this mechanism lies in the distribution of 3 actions among 4 players. Someone always misses out.&#10;&#10;If two players choose the same action (and this is often, decided by the last player as the first 3 often - not always - but often  choose actions a1, 2 and 3) the players who chose it negotiate a solution.

Will appeal to grognards who don't mind the complexity overhead.

The game has several hooks present. First, the building pool is shared, and it definitely runs out, particularly the smaller ones (residences and commercial of 1 or 2 plot size), as well as the one plot special buildings which call for specific neighbours (i.e.: 2 residences adjacent, &c.). Second, the street car lines, which are multipliers, can often turn into evil pissing matches as they are frequently used to bisect plots to prevent larger buildings from being placed (they are also often run into dead ends, presuming that one plays with the proper non-branching rules). Third, the board is modular, and because having cards for adjacent plots is a good thing, being able to place neighbourhoods in advantageous ways can greatly aid that cause. But your opponent might not be pleased with where you put that new plot of land. All the better.  The bottom line is that Big City is a lighter game. It is card driven, and getting a good run of cards at the right time will make you win, especially if you can get a majority of the special spoiler pieces (parks, factories) which can be laid down anywhere on the board (with certain restrictions), and which do not require one to have the actual plot cards for the spaces they are being put down on (i.e.: hose city). That said, especially at the two scale, there are a lot of little things that one can do to win at this game, and at that 2 scale, one is often able to KNOW where the other cards for a neighbourhood are, as the decks run out. This, in turn, makes this game much less chaotic (and more interesting). Because the piece pool is shared, and stays the same at all scales, this game is best with only 2, in fact, I exclusively play it with that number. Any more than that, and you have almost no way of knowing where people have pairs or triplicates of cards in a row, and you can inadvertently aid them with placements much too easily. With 2 though, this is one of my favourites. It's light, but it's always a blast.  Aside: As of 2018 there is a new edition of this game being made. I am not personally all that favorable to most of the new additions I've seen in that, but I do like the ascending City Hall variant that makes City Hall worth a starting value of 0, but then move up by 1 each round to a maximum of 5 as this solves the potential issue of no one wanting to spend a turn to place it. I always play with this rule in place now. The other major rule change, the forced exchange, is probably at its best in higher player count games, we tried using it for a turn or two, but didn't really care for it as it creates the need to keep track of rounds which normally is not something you need to do in this game.""}, {'@username': 'litho', '@rating': '9', '@value': 'Got it from German E-bay, Jun 2005!

It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.&#10;&#10;Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win.&#10;&#10;(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)&#10;&#10;This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.&#10;&#10;Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a &quot;technology tree,&quot; allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained.

Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and whether to try and break the other sides' lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic, detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on cardstock and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is a standalone game that can also serve as one element of the complete EuroFront series which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&#10;&#10;This title uses the Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of the &quot;Front&quot; series of games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This accomplishes two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that allows units to take losses in steps of their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.&#10;&#10;With the use of blocks, Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1991'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '2'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '9', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '5'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '9'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '6'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '2', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '2', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '366', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@level': '367', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '368', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@level': '369', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '370', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '12'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1019', '@value': 'Wargame'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1049', '@value': 'World War II'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2026', '@value': 'Hexagon Grid'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2016', '@value': 'Secret Unit Deployment'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2070', '@value': 'Simulation'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '6137', '@value': 'Components: Block Wargames'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '11966', '@value': 'Country: Russia'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '18581', '@value': 'Country: Soviet Union'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '73775', '@value': 'History: World War II (Eastern Front)'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '61979', '@value': 'Players: Two-Player Only Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '2299', '@value': 'Series: Front Series (Columbia)'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '81', '@value': 'EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '80', '@value': 'VolgaFront: East of EastFront 1942-43'}, {'@type': 'boardgameaccessory', '@id': '325669', '@value': 'EuroFront Series Wargaming Map'}, {'@type': 'boardgameimplementation', '@id': '22143', '@value': 'EastFront: The War in Russia 1941-45 – Second Edition'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '62', '@value': 'Craig Besinque'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '64', '@value': 'Tom Dalgliesh'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '3414', '@value': 'Eric Hotz'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '49', '@value': 'Columbia Games'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '688', 'comment': [{'@username': 'jctaylor2', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'There are dozens of games that cover this most popular of campaigns, but EasFront is easily the best.

You've got a wide variety of scenarios, from the desperate ('41 and '45) to the tightly-matched clash of titans ('42). The pace of the game is perfect. You've got critical decisions to make at the tactical (managing hexside limits, techniques of cracking defensive positions), operational (where to spend valuable HQ steps), and strategic (how to spend production). You've got a great, realistic historical feel. Individual scenarios are quite satisfying, or you can link them into much larger games. And you can combine the whole thing with West and MedFront.  All in all, I'm hard-pressed to figure out what more you could ask for in a (war)game. Maybe you'd like some sort of card mechanism to add the variability of political events to add a little more strategic depth, but there are legitimate reasons for not trying this (WWII:Barbarossa to Berlin, despite its many charms, could sometimes seem like a bit of a mish-mash in this respect).""}, {'@username': 'napstyle', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'A great game with a beautiful map.'}, {'@username': 'Amberite', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'Lovely war game.'}, {'@username': 'SpaceGamer', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'EastFront plus VolgaFront is, quite simply, a work of art.

It is difficult enough to fit four blocks in, but try having eight fight an extended battle.

The continuous blitz strategy for the Germans in S41 is a bit cheesy and outright unrealistic with respect to speed of advance. A houserule of converting railroads like in Russian Front fixes that. However, the beauty of the game is that also that blob strategy is stoppable. The game is sort of a paper-scissors-rock game, any strategy can be countered!

Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to try and break the other sides lines. Additional rules are included for amphibious invasions. Several scenarios cover every major point of the war. The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Western Europe and Italy printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is one section of the complete EuroFront series that covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    WestFront II: The War in Europe 1943-45 &#226;&#128;&#147; Second Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45&#10;&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1992'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '2'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '3', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '1', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '1', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '371', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '372', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '373', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@level': '374', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '375', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '12'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1019', '@value': 'Wargame'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1049', '@value': 'World War II'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2026', '@value': 'Hexagon Grid'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2016', '@value': 'Secret Unit Deployment'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '6137', '@value': 'Components: Block Wargames'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '61979', '@value': 'Players: Two-Player Only Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '2299', '@value': 'Series: Front Series (Columbia)'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '81', '@value': 'EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45'}, {'@type': 'boardgameaccessory', '@id': '325669', '@value': 'EuroFront Series Wargaming Map'}, {'@type': 'boardgameintegration', '@id': '79', '@value': 'MedFront: War in North Africa 1940-43'}, {'@type': 'boardgameimplementation', '@id': '22161', '@value': 'WestFront II: The War in Europe 1943-45 – Second Edition'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '62', '@value': 'Craig Besinque'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '3414', '@value': 'Eric Hotz'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '49', '@value': 'Columbia Games'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '191', 'comment': [{'@username': 'Nick Barker', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'Mine is a minority opinion, but I enjoy this game every bit as much as the more popular EastFront, possibly because I find the subject matter more interesting.

And then there&#039;s an early invasion of France possible.  The fog of war provided by the blocks really shines in this game - perhaps too much!  If the allies invade a fully stacked fortress, they&#039;ll usually disintigrate ... but would the allies really have been that clueless regarding German defenses?  The only reason I don&#039;t rate this game higher is the grim and grueling fate that awaits the German player in the summer of &#039;44.  You can&#039;t hardly move your divisions, you can&#039;t hardly rebuild losses, it&#039;s hard to maintain HQ points, and all you really end of doing is covering up on the ropes an pray for the bell.  At least, that&#039;s how it feels to me - others have told me that actually enjoy such torture!  This isn&#039;t the game&#039;s fault, however - it&#039;s the nature of the campaign WestFront so excellently simulates.

Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to break the other side's lines and achieve victory.  The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Spain and North Africa printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is just one portion of the complete EuroFront series, which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This does two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.  With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;WestFront II: The War in Europe 1943-45 &#226;&#128;&#147; Second Edition includes updated MedFront maps and some Spanish units; EuroFront: The War in Europe, 1936-45 &#226;&#128;&#147; Second Edition has the updated MedFront rules (and the Spanish Civil War scenario and other Spanish units) for those maps.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45&#10;&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1994'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '2'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '3', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '3', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '3', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '376', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '377', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@level': '378', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@level': '379', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '380', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '180'},{'@value': '180'},{'@value': '180'},{'@value': '12'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1019', '@value': 'Wargame'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1049', '@value': 'World War II'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2676', '@value': 'Grid Movement'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2026', '@value': 'Hexagon Grid'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2016', '@value': 'Secret Unit Deployment'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2070', '@value': 'Simulation'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '6137', '@value': 'Components: Block Wargames'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '79503', '@value': ""Decades: The 1940's""}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '61979', '@value': 'Players: Two-Player Only Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '72016', '@value': 'Players: Wargames with Rules Supporting Only Two Players'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '2299', '@value': 'Series: Front Series (Columbia)'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '81', '@value': 'EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45'}, {'@type': 'boardgameintegration', '@id': '78', '@value': 'WestFront: The War in Europe, 1943-45'}, {'@type': 'boardgameimplementation', '@id': '22160', '@value': 'EuroFront: The War in Europe, 1936-45 – Second Edition'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '62', '@value': 'Craig Besinque'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '49', '@value': 'Columbia Games'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '127', 'comment': [{'@username': 'Doel', '@rating': '9', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'dennisvondoom', '@rating': '9', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'markasol', '@rating': '9', '@value': 'blockfront'}, {'@username': 'RonCarlson01', '@rating': '8.5', '@value': 'W07'}, {'@username': 'BunkerBill', '@rating': '8.3', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'cfarrell', '@rating': '8', '@value': ""Cool game, but not really a standalone - the desert war involves only a few blocks, so anyone hoping for Rommel in the Desert part II will be disappointed.

It provides an eastern map extension of Russia so that a complete picture of the strategic possibilities during WWII in Germany's fight with the Soviet Union.  It also comes with an additional EastFront rulebook and a set of new scenarios that utilize the map extension directly.  EastFront: The War in Russia, 1941-45 is required to play with the VolgaFront map.  VolgaFront is also part of the EuroFront series.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;EastFront: The War in Russia 1941-45 &#226;&#128;&#147; Second Edition includes most of the VolgaFront map (but not scenarios).&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    EastFront: The War in Russia, 1941-45&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45&#10;&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1994'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '2'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '3', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '2', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '4', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '381', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@level': '382', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '383', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@level': '384', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '385', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '12'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1042', '@value': 'Expansion for Base-game'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1019', '@value': 'Wargame'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1049', '@value': 'World War II'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2676', '@value': 'Grid Movement'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2026', '@value': 'Hexagon Grid'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2016', '@value': 'Secret Unit Deployment'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '6137', '@value': 'Components: Block Wargames'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '11966', '@value': 'Country: Russia'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '73775', '@value': 'History: World War II (Eastern Front)'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '61979', '@value': 'Players: Two-Player Only Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '72016', '@value': 'Players: Wargames with Rules Supporting Only Two Players'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '27506', '@value': 'Rivers: Volga'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '2299', '@value': 'Series: Front Series (Columbia)'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '81', '@value': 'EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '77', '@value': 'EastFront: The War in Russia, 1941-45', '@inbound': 'true'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '63', '@value': 'Tim Taylor'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '3414', '@value': 'Eric Hotz'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '49', '@value': 'Columbia Games'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '69', 'comment': [{'@username': 'MikeOberly', '@rating': '10', '@value': ""I give this a '10', since Eastfront is a '10' to me.

It comes with a beautiful card-stock map of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Eastern Virginia and heaps of wooden blocks for the North and South.  The game utilizes both a strategic layer of the conflict but also provides a slightly more tactical layer of combat with additional battle maps that allow for center, and flank positions of specific units.  The game can be combined with Sam Grant so that both theaters of the Civil War can be played out at the same time.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;All artwork and graphics in the game Bobby Lee was created by RPG/Historical artist, Eric Hotz.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1993'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '2'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '5', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '2', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '6', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '391', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '392', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@level': '393', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@level': '394', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@level': '395', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '12'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1048', '@value': 'American Civil War'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1019', '@value': 'Wargame'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2016', '@value': 'Secret Unit Deployment'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '6137', '@value': 'Components: Block Wargames'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '14835', '@value': 'Country: USA'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '8374', '@value': 'Crowdfunding: Kickstarter'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '81575', '@value': 'Digital Implementations: VASSAL'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '61979', '@value': 'Players: Two-Player Only Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '43671', '@value': 'States: Virginia'}, {'@type': 'boardgameintegration', '@id': '83', '@value': 'Sam Grant: The Civil War in the West 1862-1864'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '64', '@value': 'Tom Dalgliesh'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '3414', '@value': 'Eric Hotz'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '49', '@value': 'Columbia Games'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '375', 'comment': [{'@username': 'ButchieToetracks', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'mickeywhitney', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'Kukko', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'My rating applies only to the 3rd edition as I have no experience with the former ones.

The tactical battle resolution familiar from Napoleon, trimmed to near perfection here, is a great addition to the ""EastFront Lite"" command control system. The battle system adds another layer of agonizing decisions and most importantly is FUN. Even the longest scenario usually doesn\'t play longer than 6 months of EastFront, so in that regard Bobby Lee is a definite go to game for me.

Allow me to respond to the common criticisms.  Criticism no. 1 - the game is static and reflects the feel of WWI trench warfare, not the Civil War.  Well, it is if you play it that way but not only don&#039;t you have to, it&#039;s unwise to if you want to maximize your chances for victory.  The Union has four avenues of attack available to him - the Shenandoah Valley, the Piedmont, the Penninsula, and Norfolk.  Inexperienced players usually just mass the blue blocks in the center, eye the Piedmont, and opt for &quot;hey-diddle-diddle, straight-down-the-middle.&quot;  The Rebel player says, fine, let&#039;s party - and the Union hits a wall.  Well folks, there a reason that none of the Union commanders had the guts to try this.  And it wouldn&#039;t have worked for Grant earlier in the war were he on the scene either.  If the Union forces the Reb to spread out by threatenging two or three fronts, he can thin the lines enought to break through into Virginia somewhere if he plays his cards right - or even tempt the Confederate into an offensive north that&#039;s more a trap than an opportunity.  In fact, I&#039;ve had as much dramatic give-and-take in this game as I&#039;ve had in &quot;EastFront&quot;!  Miracle come-backs and wild swings of fortune are more than occaissional happenstances.  Criticism no. 2 - Bobby Lee ignores too much about the campaigns in Virginia like the trench warfare around Petersberg.  Well, consider it abstracted into the battleboard system (which works wonderfully in this game, by the way, and poses fascinating tactical quandries).  But look, if you want a soup-to-nuts simulation, there are indeed games that will do that better than Bobby Lee.  But if you want a game that focuses on the big picture and is more concerned with putting you in the commanders&#039; shoes, this game can&#039;t be beat.  I suspect that this is a tough game to &quot;master&quot; for many and few give it the time necessary to discover all the richness that can be initially overlooked in a first playing.

But, still, it's a great improvement over perfect intelligence.  A great Civil War game: fast playing, relatively easy to learn and fun.

I sold it after 2 plays several years ago.   In the last 2 years I was convinced by comments from people I respect like Jerry Taylor that I need to play this again. I traded for a new copy and revised the battle system to a simpler style in the vein of Liberty and Hammer. The initial playtest of that scenario was quite promising. The game went smoother, faster, and the fun of manuevering on the Civil War map was unmasked. If it holds up and proves to be well balanced I'll post my changes here eventually.

It comes with a beautiful card-stock map from Vicksburg to Cincinnati and heaps of wooden blocks for the North and South.  The game utilizes both a strategic layer of the conflict but also provides a slightly more tactical layer of combat with additional battle maps that allow for center, and flank positions of specific units.  The game can be combined with Bobby Lee so that both theaters of the Civil War can be played out at the same time.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;All artwork and graphics in the game Sam Grant was created by RPG/Historical artist,  Eric Hotz.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1997'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '2'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '2', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '1', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '0', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '396', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '397', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '398', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '399', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '400', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '180'},{'@value': '180'},{'@value': '180'},{'@value': '12'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1048', '@value': 'American Civil War'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1019', '@value': 'Wargame'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2016', '@value': 'Secret Unit Deployment'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '6137', '@value': 'Components: Block Wargames'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '61979', '@value': 'Players: Two-Player Only Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgameintegration', '@id': '82', '@value': 'Bobby Lee: The Civil War in Virginia 1861-1865'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '64', '@value': 'Tom Dalgliesh'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '65', '@value': 'Gary Selkirk'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '3414', '@value': 'Eric Hotz'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '49', '@value': 'Columbia Games'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '148', 'comment': [{'@username': 'The Eraser', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'RonCarlson01', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'Brwychopen', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'RonCarlson02', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'NIS'}, {'@username': 'Stip1134', '@rating': '9.4', '@value': 'I just played this linked with Bobby lee in the grand campaign with 4 players and I gotta say this is THE way to play this! It’s super cool how you can help your ally out in the other theater by giving them part of your replacement pints or by moving people via the rail road system and it totally changes up the games and makes it feel like the war is a really wide spread situation. Plotting and scheming with your ally in the other theater makes for some very different gameplay than what you would get with just 2 players playing one theater. I’d like to see more people write about the combined game in the forums but as it is it seems most people that have played this have not done this. Sam Grant by its self is not nearly as good as it is when you combine it with the eastern theater. I and my ally played as the confederates and with our combined work we were able to win the war within 5 months. Things in the west are a bit more of a slog than in the east but the crucial victory we achieved in the west was helped largely due to the union deciding to invade kentucky which gave the militia to us. After we gained control we sent them up to Cincinnati where they got double defense and took away 3 victory points from the union and kept them pre occupied which gave me the flexibility to commit 3 of my blocks to the eastern theater which by the 5th month helped the confederate army take advantage of a weakness in the union lines and charge into Washington DC which scored us 6vp’s and then gave us an easily defendable target that the union was compelled to attack. After that we got the win when the union lost a huge number of troops trying to take dc. Our opponents were way mor focused on their own theaters and I think only shared rp’s once. Had they worked together more as a team I have little doubt that game could have been made much more difficult for us.

With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;(from BGG user)&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1982'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '2'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '18', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '14'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '18'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '14'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '7', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '9', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '401', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@level': '402', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@level': '403', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@level': '404', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '405', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '480'},{'@value': '180'},{'@value': '480'},{'@value': '12'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1019', '@value': 'Wargame'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1049', '@value': 'World War II'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2026', '@value': 'Hexagon Grid'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2016', '@value': 'Secret Unit Deployment'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2070', '@value': 'Simulation'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '6137', '@value': 'Components: Block Wargames'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '6471', '@value': 'Country: Egypt'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '13244', '@value': 'Country: Libya'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '72674', '@value': 'Digital Implementations: Rally the Troops'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '53215', '@value': 'History: World War II (Africa)'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '61979', '@value': 'Players: Two-Player Only Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '72016', '@value': 'Players: Wargames with Rules Supporting Only Two Players'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '59607', '@value': 'Region: North Africa'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '13265', '@value': 'Theme: Deserts'}, {'@type': 'boardgameaccessory', '@id': '381476', '@value': 'Rommel in the Desert: Giant Neoprene Map'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '62', '@value': 'Craig Besinque'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '64', '@value': 'Tom Dalgliesh'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '68', '@value': 'Ron Gibson'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '68731', '@value': 'Jody Harmon'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '3414', '@value': 'Eric Hotz'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '49', '@value': 'Columbia Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '39751', '@value': 'Do it games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '8689', '@value': 'Game Preserve'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '1091', 'comment': [{'@username': 'Nick Barker', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'In my view, an almost flawless wargame and probably my all time favourite.

Other designers have expended a lot of effort determining that 21st Pz is a 10-8-21, and the 7th Armoured is a 8-7-24, or whatever,  while giving only scant attention to FOW. Both avenues have merit, but RitD is a good game because it's easy to play, and tense. As a bonus to this, it gives the player a lot of insight into important factors which heavily affected the campaign.  Note: this really isn't that difficult a game to play, but reading the rules of this one made my eyes glaze over like few others. It would be a lot easier to have someone show you the game.  Also, stay away from the 1940 scenario, aside from doing it once maybe to learn some of the mechanics.

The game comes with a gorgeous map drawn in the style of the period. Movement is conducted via a point-to-point system following the roads and towns in the area around Quebec. The game comes with handfuls of blocks to represent the British and French units.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their wargames are based on the block system. Basically this means that rather than using the traditional counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side. This does two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength. Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number. Although most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides. Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1972'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '2'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '11', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '8'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '11'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '7'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '8', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '10', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '406', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@level': '407', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@level': '408', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@level': '409', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '410', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '60'},{'@value': '60'},{'@value': '60'},{'@value': '12'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '2726', '@value': 'Age of Reason'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1108', '@value': 'American Indian Wars'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1019', '@value': 'Wargame'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2078', '@value': 'Point to Point Movement'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2016', '@value': 'Secret Unit Deployment'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2070', '@value': 'Simulation'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '62900', '@value': 'Cities: Quebec (Canada)'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '6137', '@value': 'Components: Block Wargames'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '10168', '@value': 'Country: Canada'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '11006', '@value': 'Country: France'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '57617', '@value': 'Country: Great Britain'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '21079', '@value': 'History: French and Indian War'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '61979', '@value': 'Players: Two-Player Only Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '72016', '@value': 'Players: Wargames with Rules Supporting Only Two Players'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '27614', '@value': 'Region: Quebec (Canada)'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '67', '@value': 'Steve Brewster'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '64', '@value': 'Tom Dalgliesh'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '66', '@value': 'Lance Gutteridge'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '49', '@value': 'Columbia Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '280', '@value': 'Gamma Two Games'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '746', 'comment': [{'@username': 'CJstratgamer', '@rating': '10', '@value': ""Talk about a lucky find!

My friend and I just played our 23rd game and it was one of the best games we ever played.  We stopped playing the game about 6 months ago because we developed an optimal French strategy that was just too tough for the British player to overcome.  I decided to give the game one more try to confirm our belief thinking that I would end up retiring the game.  Instead, we had an incredible contest.  I played the British and he played the French.  He adhered to the impenetrable French strategy, and I tried to soften him up with some territory gobbling tactics to erode his units.  We had a couple of early clashes allowing me to get a numerical superiority, and I was able to destroy his indian unit.  Then, he launched a surprise attack against a smaller force, which was surprising because he had to abandon his defensive position.  His idea was great because he inflicted a good amount of damage on me.  I was under time pressure to win because the British lose if they don’t take possession of Abraham by the end of move 16.  So, I had to launch my forces against Abraham on move 16.  I was numerically stronger and winning the battle with a route looking more and more likely.  Unfortunately for me, the British are required to keep a certain level of strength to win, and I fell below that threshold.  My opponent won by the narrowest of margins, but I was winning all along.  So, we both want a rematch.  The amazing thing is that we were able to play a war game on a Monday night, have an incredible contest, and finish in an hour.    Initial Review:  I was looking for a simple war game  to try and found that it had good reviews on BGG.  I bought this game two months ago and played it 13 times already against the same opponent. My friend and I came away from every contest pleased with the game.  First we thought the British were j just too strong because the first 4 games were won by the British side.  Then the French had 3 wins in row.  Now it goes back and forth.  Sure there is a heavy dose of luck, but only one of our 13 games was decided by luck alone.  And maybe it wasn't luck--I played the British and was repulsed by the French and tried again and was again repulsed.  I should have stopped and looked for a different place to attack.  The game wasn't inexpensive, but with 13 plays already my $45 investment is nearing $3 per play.  I think there are a lot more plays ahead.""}, {'@username': 'RichardIngram', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'keithcharnley', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'Great game.

However, it seems to me that one\'s enjoyment of this game is going to center on whether one expects to get a war game simulation with set scenarios, or whether they are going to be okay with a game that seems more like a kit that allows them to try out a virtually inexhaustible amount of scenarios which they can create themselves. That\'s what, I believe, people mean when they comment that this is more of a \'kit\' than a game.   If it\'s the \'kit\' that appeals to you, then picking up the extra maps, the elite block units, and the Logistics set are highly recommended. I find it very fun to play and am not put off by its ""ahistorical"" nature (although it\'s not based on specific geography or nations, the units represent WW2 technology). I like the system, as it\'s not difficult to understand, it plays fast, and the battles are furious but not always decisive (a good thing).   As suggested by other Geeksters, I\'ve picked up extra sets of blocks, elite units, maps, and Logistics Rules, all of which add to complexity and a more satisfying gaming experience.   I understand why some players don\'t find this their cup of tea due to its ahistorical nature, and given the cost of accumulating all the maps and blocks for this game (anything but cheap), there aren\'t that many scenarios available (either with the game or through the Columbia website), but as others point out, this is part game, part game-kit.   Personally, I can use my imagination to fight it out among fictional opponents, and there are many scenarios that gamers have created and published, many of which can be found on the Columbia Games website.   Another area of discussion about the game is whether it is overly slanted toward defense, with the complaint that battles bog down into WW1-like trench warfare, in which attacking becomes less than advisable. This can be true; however, using more than 2 maps at a time is definitely more interesting, as it spreads out units and forces more tactical and strategic choices, and tends to lessen the built-in advantage to defenders. I\'ve also taken to unbalancing forces somewhat by rolling 4 or 5 dice 10 times for each side and taking the average as the respective starting number of units. After all, in any given war, how often are forces evenly balanced, and, if you start with absolutely equal forces, does it not make sense that there would be a tendency toward stalemate? In my opinion, starting a game with somewhat unbalanced forces still provides parameters in which a player with superior tactics and production and battle dice rolls can achieve victory.  The more I think about this game, the more I tend to believe that it\'s a solid design, and its only limitations are one\'s imagination, so on that count I like it a lot. Also, I find that playing this generic block game helps to learn more specific, historical block games quicker.  Note: Maps 1-4 come with the game. In addition to the base game, I also have acquired extra Maps 5-16 and the blank map as well as the much-recommended ""Logistics Set"" and Elite Blocks sets Red, Blue Green, and Gray--which add different types of units, such as elite armor, jets, and various types of naval and air units not included in the base set.

One thing that sets this game apart is how easy battles are: there are no combat modifers at all, and resolving fights is as easy as going down the order of battle and rolling the number of dice each unit gets.  As units are wounded, their cube is rotated to show the damage, which is also how many dice they roll.  Hits are easy to determine (a set number on a d6).  Air power also has the ability to respond to a fight even for the defender, allowing some measure of reaction when it's not your turn.

The block system is quite ingenious and offers very good fog-of-war, not to mention there is no need to record anything as it is all done using the blocks (and rotating them to record hits/damage).  Each unit is rated for Air, Land, Sea (combat) and Movement, which results in units having different specialties.  In turn, this provides the units with certain advantages and disadvantages.  Combat system is also interesting; it is an advanced version of what is seen in Axis & Allies, with priority given to faster units, the defender always firing first when both players have the same type of units present.  Combat system rewards combined arms approach, and requires multiple waves to break through a well-defended area.  If your attack is not well planned and supported, it will most likely fail, especially if the dice Gods are not on your side.  Advantage goes to the low rollers  ;-)  Recommend getting the ELITE expansion, which adds more units.  The map expansions are also good to have.  Down side: The game can bog down with multiple players as there is not much interaction except for the ""Air Response"" phase during which the defender can move air units (and Mech units with the ELITE expansion) to an area under attack.

I know I've held you in my hand, why didn't I take you home? Three games on Yucata and I can tell I love you, Torres!  Three-dimensional abstract, with cards that allow for unexpected moves. The beauty is that scoring each building is a product of surface and height (and you can't increase height beyond the surface area). This means you can't simply take the action that gives you the most points each turn. Going from 1x1 to 2x2 isn't much, but if you don't do that, you'll never get to 8x8. Then you have to consider two costs: the number of actions, and the number of blocks are both limiting what you can do. And with every block you place, every knight you move away, you create opportunities for your opponents, but if all you do is piggyback them, you'll always be behind. And how many actions can you spend just to block the other players?  There's a beautiful catch-up mechanism too: a king pawn gives a bonus to everyone on the correct level in his castle. Every player can potentially get the bonus, but the player with the lowest score decides where the king goes, so he or she should have an easier time getting it. This means the other players will have to adapt, and maybe abandon their building/climbing engine to do something on the other side of the board, giving the players with lower scores a chance to catch up.  I love games where your decisions are based on future potential of yourself and others, and not simply on a numeric value of points per action or something similar.  The rules are very simple, and yet in every game I play I'm completely surprised by what my opponents are pulling off. I'm generally happy with the moves I make, think I'm picking the right one out of all the possibilities, but I've yet to win a game, so I'm still missing a lot of potentially better plays.  Torres is a tight game, with a great balance between freedom and constriction, between building something and blocking opponents, with simple rules and non-obvious decisions.

A luck element can be implemented here as well (playing without random card draws does alter the pace of the game!). As for the strategy, there isn't much brain burning - the tastiest bits of the board become clear relatively soon, so that the play gets cutthroat just afterwards. The downside of it is that turning the tables after a quicker player has reached the biggest castle is not that easy.  Torres is an absolute treat - several ways to move forward (especially at the beginning), not just area but volume control (!) and frequent difficult decisions within a tight (temporal and spatial) frame absent in the mask trilogy make this fairly complex game the best of the Kramer-Kiesling output in the wake of El Grande.""}, {'@username': 'jfesser', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'woj_settlers', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'Bartjes', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'Papachango', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'Need to get this one out more.

Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     316 full-color die-cut counters:&#10;         176 5/8&rdquo; die cut counters&#10;         140 1/2&rdquo; die cut counters&#10;    &#10;     One 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East&#10;     110 Strategy Cards&#10;     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)&#10;     Two Player Reference Cards &#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ted Raicer&#10;DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.&#10;&#10;While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1999'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '2'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '101', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '32'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '47'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '90'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '62'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '37', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '21'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '12'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '34', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '431', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '432', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '433', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@level': '434', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '28'}, {'@level': '435', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '4'}]}}]",{'@value': '480'},{'@value': '480'},{'@value': '480'},{'@value': '14'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1019', '@value': 'Wargame'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1065', '@value': 'World War I'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2018', '@value': 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2078', '@value': 'Point to Point Movement'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '50153', '@value': 'Continents: Europe'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '11006', '@value': 'Country: France'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '59705', '@value': 'Misc: LongPack Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '61979', '@value': 'Players: Two-Player Only Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '59608', '@value': 'Region: Middle East'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '329723', '@value': 'CDG Solo System'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '26916', '@value': ""Paths of Glory: Player's Guide""}, {'@type': 'boardgameaccessory', '@id': '31094', '@value': 'Paths of Glory: Deluxe Map'}, {'@type': 'boardgameaccessory', '@id': '138496', '@value': 'Paths of Glory: Mounted Mapboard'}, {'@type': 'boardgameintegration', '@id': '23418', '@value': 'Pursuit of Glory'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '484', '@value': 'Ted Raicer'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '2652', '@value': 'Charles Kibler'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '23441', '@value': 'Terry Leeds'}, {'@type': 'boardgameartist', '@id': '71', '@value': 'Rodger B.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1995'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '5'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '657', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '384'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '71'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '419'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '32'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '277'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '205'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '222'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '335'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '19'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '476'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '113'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '21'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '266'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '104', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '32'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '51'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '11'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '1'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '125', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '436', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '4'}, {'@level': '437', '@value': 'Some necessary text -

On each turn, players must choose between expanding a company to increase its value and adding a share of stock to their hand, or playing stock onto the table from their hand to increase their ownership of one or two companies.  There are four semi-random scoring events, in which the first and second place share holder in each company are paid dividends.  Only stock that has been previously played onto the table is considered during the scoring rounds.   Union Pacific is a special company whose shares are claimed according to special rules.  Union Pacific is not represented on the board but instead pays dividends to all share holders according to a fixed progression chart.  Money is only used to track victory conditions and cannot be spent during the game.

First, the scoring cards are more sanely distributed in the deck: after dealing hands and making the initial display, deal four stacks of six cards and divide the rest of the deck roughly into quarters; shuffle a scoring card into each quarter and put a stack of six cards on each, then stack those to make the deck.  Back-to-back, game-breaking scoring cards won't happen.  Second, the payouts for Union Pacific are changed from 0-10-15-20 for first place to 0-5-10-15.  This keeps UP from being a required part of a winning strategy.

It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea.  There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.&#10;&#10;The second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.&#10;&#10;The components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.  Lastly the board is full color and styled in the period.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note that the first edition was published in 1982 by Larry Harris, Jr. (Citadel Game Systems) and came in a box similar in size to the Games Workshop Ltd. or The Avalon Hill Game Co games.  There are no elaborate plastic ships, cannons or playing pieces in the original edition, though.  You get paper maps and cardboard counters.&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1982'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '2'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '2', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '1', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '0', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '451', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '452', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '453', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '454', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '455', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '60'},{'@value': '60'},{'@value': '60'},{'@value': '10'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1008', '@value': 'Nautical'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1090', '@value': 'Pirates'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1019', '@value': 'Wargame'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2689', '@value': 'Action Queue'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2676', '@value': 'Grid Movement'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2040', '@value': 'Hand Management'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2078', '@value': 'Point to Point Movement'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2940', '@value': 'Square Grid'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '25158', '@value': 'Components: Miniatures'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '61979', '@value': 'Players: Two-Player Only Games'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '89', '@value': 'Series: Gamemaster (Milton Bradley)'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '575', '@value': 'Larry Harris, Jr.'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '39609', '@value': ""Citadel's Game Series (CGS)""}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '20', '@value': 'Milton Bradley'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '597', 'comment': [{'@username': 'Helmut', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'bodtchboy', '@rating': '10', '@value': '2 thumbs up & in my top 10 games of all time.

Eventually through elimination one player pulls ahead for the win.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Eagle Games's Conquest of the Empire (2005)&#10;&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1984'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '6'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '10', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '7'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '6'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '7'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '6'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '7'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}]}, {'@numplayers': '6+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '4'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '8', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '6'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '4', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '456', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '457', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@level': '458', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@level': '459', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '460', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '180'},{'@value': '240'},{'@value': '10'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1050', '@value': 'Ancient'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1021', '@value': 'Economic'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1019', '@value': 'Wargame'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2046', '@value': 'Area Movement'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '5606', '@value': 'Ancient: Rome'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '64960', '@value': 'Components: Map (Continental / National scale)'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '25158', '@value': 'Components: Miniatures'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '81575', '@value': 'Digital Implementations: VASSAL'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '58534', '@value': 'History: Roman Empire'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '58955', '@value': 'Region: Mediterranean Sea'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '89', '@value': 'Series: Gamemaster (Milton Bradley)'}, {'@type': 'boardgameimplementation', '@id': '17710', '@value': 'Conquest of the Empire'}, {'@type': 'boardgameimplementation', '@id': '1478', '@value': 'VI Caesars', '@inbound': 'true'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '575', '@value': 'Larry Harris, Jr.'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '20', '@value': 'Milton Bradley'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '1059', 'comment': [{'@username': 'stevevm', '@rating': '10', '@value': ''}, {'@username': 'hooligan1', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'Can I give this game an 11? possibly my all-time fave.

Up to five players can play on two different teams. The Axis which has Germany and Japan, and the Allies which has the USA, the United Kingdom, and the USSR. A full map of the world is provided, broken up in various chunks similar to Risk. The game comes with gobs of plastic miniatures that represent various military units during WWII.  Players have at their disposal infantry, armor, fighters, bombers, battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, troop transports, anti-air guns, and factories. All of the units perform differently and many have special functions. Players have to work together with their teammates in order to coordinate offenses and decide how best to utilize their production points. Players also have the option of risking production resources on the possibility of developing a super technology that might turn the tide of war.&#10;&#10;Axis and Allies was originally published by Nova Games in 1981.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Axis & Allies Anniversary Edition&#10;     Axis &amp; Allies: Global 1940 (Axis & Allies: Pacific 1940 combined with Axis & Allies: Europe 1940)&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Totally Untested Volume 2 of Max's Advanced Rules for Axis & Allies (Unofficial expansion)&#10;    Conquest of the Pacific (Unofficial expansion)&#10;    Midway (Unofficial expansion)&#10;&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1981'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '5'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '150', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '91'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '92'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '33'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '9'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '7'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '67'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '46'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '23'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '73'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '29'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '90'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '29'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '20'}]}, {'@numplayers': '5+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '74'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '53', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '3'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '11'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '25'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '12'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '30', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '461', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '13'}, {'@level': '462', '@value': 'Some necessary text -

From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.&#10;&#10;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special &quot;Star Wars&quot; laser relay systems that fire from space.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (2012)&#10;&#10;&#10;",{'@value': '1986'},{'@value': '2'},{'@value': '4'},"[{'@name': 'suggested_numplayers', '@title': 'User Suggested Number of Players', '@totalvotes': '45', 'results': [{'@numplayers': '1', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '24'}]}, {'@numplayers': '2', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '23'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '15'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}]}, {'@numplayers': '3', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '2'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '27'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '9'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '29'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '2'}]}, {'@numplayers': '4+', 'result': [{'@value': 'Best', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': 'Recommended', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': 'Not Recommended', '@numvotes': '25'}]}]}, {'@name': 'suggested_playerage', '@title': 'User Suggested Player Age', '@totalvotes': '15', 'results': {'result': [{'@value': '2', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '3', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '4', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '5', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '6', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '8', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '10', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@value': '12', '@numvotes': '9'}, {'@value': '14', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@value': '16', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '18', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@value': '21 and up', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}, {'@name': 'language_dependence', '@title': 'Language Dependence', '@totalvotes': '14', 'results': {'result': [{'@level': '466', '@value': 'No necessary in-game text', '@numvotes': '0'}, {'@level': '467', '@value': 'Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet', '@numvotes': '8'}, {'@level': '468', '@value': 'Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups', '@numvotes': '5'}, {'@level': '469', '@value': 'Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable', '@numvotes': '1'}, {'@level': '470', '@value': 'Unplayable in another language', '@numvotes': '0'}]}}]",{'@value': '180'},{'@value': '180'},{'@value': '180'},{'@value': '12'},"[{'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1016', '@value': 'Science Fiction'}, {'@type': 'boardgamecategory', '@id': '1019', '@value': 'Wargame'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2046', '@value': 'Area Movement'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2072', '@value': 'Dice Rolling'}, {'@type': 'boardgamemechanic', '@id': '2070', '@value': 'Simulation'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '14835', '@value': 'Country: USA'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '89', '@value': 'Series: Gamemaster (Milton Bradley)'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '26464', '@value': 'Theme: Alternate History'}, {'@type': 'boardgamefamily', '@id': '64809', '@value': 'Theme: Helicopters'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '32619', '@value': '5th Column (fan expansion for Fortress America)'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '13119', '@value': 'Fortress America: Expansion Pack #1'}, {'@type': 'boardgameexpansion', '@id': '27727', '@value': 'Fortress Illinois'}, {'@type': 'boardgameimplementation', '@id': '115293', '@value': 'Fortress America'}, {'@type': 'boardgamedesigner', '@id': '287', '@value': 'Michael Gray'}, {'@type': 'boardgamepublisher', '@id': '20', '@value': 'Milton Bradley'}]","{'@page': '1', '@totalitems': '2532', 'comment': [{'@username': 'LyranFan', '@rating': '10', '@value': 'Love the pieces and simplicity of the game.

I know people have different tastes in board games, and this may not be for everyone, but this is an intricately balanced slugfest of a game. Although everybody gets the exact same units, the experience as the US and as each invader is completely different.

Outstanding Game (always want to play it and expect this will never change)  The absolute best of the old Milton Bradley ""Game Master Series"".

I didn\'t fully appreciate the genius of these rules back in the 1980s but I\'m seeing more and more depth and elegance each time I play it and it\'s quickly become one of my very favourite games!  Great Mechanics that are simple but really enhance play: Order of Casualties, different dice sizes and colours for different units, combined arms, etc. a lot of the latest games could learn a thing or two from this one.   Great Balance: almost every game is too close to call, and each game you learn something new as do your opponents and you have to adapt to their new strategy as they adapt to yours.  Some people can\'t get over the cheeziness of the theme but you need to sit them down with a 6-pack of Duff in front of Red Dawn to give them the flavour of 80s Kapitalist anti-red paranoia.
